🚀 Excited to share PeopleHub - an open-source LinkedIn people search engine!

I built a tool that makes finding professionals incredibly simple. Just type what you're looking for in plain English:

✨ "10 AI Engineers in SF"
✨ "Software engineers at MiniMax"
✨ "Elon Musk"

## Why I built this:

Networking shouldn't require complex Boolean searches or LinkedIn Premium filters. Natural language is how we think - it should be how we search.

## The best part? It's 100% open source! 🎉

Whether you're a recruiter, founder, or developer - this tool is for you.

- ✅ Engaging hook in first 2 lines
- ✅ Call-to-action at the end (question to drive comments)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Personal story ("Why I built this")
- Technical credibility (detailed stack)
- Visual appeal (mention 3D animations)
- Community involvement (open source + question)
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant tags at the end

**Best Time to Post:**

- Avoid weekends

**Follow-up Actions:**
1. Reply to every comment within first hour
2. Share post with close connections to kickstart engagement
3. Post link in first comment (not main post)
4. Consider creating a short demo video/GIF as carousel first slide

**Alternative Opening Hooks:**
